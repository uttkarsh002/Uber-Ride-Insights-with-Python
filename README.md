## 🧐 Introduction

Uber has revolutionized the way we think about transportation. This project aims to analyze Uber ride data to extract meaningful insights about ride patterns, popular routes, peak hours, and more. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, we can better understand the dynamics of ride-sharing services.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features related to Uber rides such as:
- **Date/Time**: The date and time of the ride
- **Lat/Long**: The latitude and longitude of the pickup and dropoff locations
- **Base**: The TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber ride
- **Miles**: The distance of the ride

This rich dataset allows us to perform an in-depth analysis of ride behavior and trends over time.

## 🛠️ Installation

To run this analysis, you'll need to set up your Python environment with the necessary libraries. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uber-data-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd uber-data-analysis
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🏃 Usage

To perform the analysis, simply run the Jupyter notebook:
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `Uber_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook and run all the cells to see the analysis in action.

## 🔍 Analysis Overview

The analysis is broken down into several sections:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of rides, distances, and times.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Understanding ride patterns over different time periods.
4. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping pickup and dropoff locations.
5. **Distance Analysis**: Investigating the distribution of ride distances.

Each section contains visualizations and statistical summaries to help illustrate the findings.

## 📈 Results

Some of the key findings from this analysis include:
- **Peak Hours**: Most rides occur during evening rush hours.
- **Popular Locations**: Specific areas have higher concentrations of pickups and dropoffs.
- **Ride Distance**: The majority of rides are within a 5-mile radius.

For a detailed discussion of the results, please refer to the notebook.
